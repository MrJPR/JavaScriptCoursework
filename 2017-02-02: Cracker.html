<h2>Let's crack that password!</h2>

You entered:
<h3 id="UPass"></h3>

The ASCII codes for your password are:
<p id="ASCII"></p>

The password that the script came up with is:
<p id="SPass"></p>

It took the script this many cycles to figure out your password:
<p id="cycles"></p>

<a href="javascript:location.reload(true)">Click to try another password!</a>
<script>
//User input
var Pass = prompt("Enter in a complex three-character password.","D~*");

//Individual password characters
var C1 = Pass.charCodeAt(0);
var C2 = Pass.charCodeAt(1);
var C3 = Pass.charCodeAt(2);

//Open ASCII variables
var T1 = "";
var T2 = "";
var T3 = "";

//Cycles until ASCII value of C1 is the same
for (i=0; i<=C1; i++){
	if (i == C1) { break;}
	T1 = i + 1;}

//Cycles until ASCII value of C2 is the same
for (j=0; j<=C2; j++){
	if (j == C2) { break;}
	T2 = j + 1;}

//Cycles until ASCII value of C3 is the same
for (k=0; k<=C3; k++){
	if (k == C3) { break;}
	T3 = k + 1;}

//Password characters from the FOR loops
var P1 = String.fromCharCode(T1);
var P2 = String.fromCharCode(T2);
var P3 = String.fromCharCode(T3);

//Java -> HTML
document.getElementById("UPass").innerHTML = Pass;
document.getElementById("ASCII").innerHTML = T1 + "<br>" + T2 + "<br>" + T3;
document.getElementById("SPass").innerHTML = P1 + " " + P2 + " " + P3;
document.getElementById("cycles").innerHTML = i + j + k;
